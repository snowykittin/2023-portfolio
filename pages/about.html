                <p>My name is <span class="fact">Summer</span>, but you may see me online under the alias <span

                <p>
                    I've been programming as long as I've been able to be on the internet. It started with editing
                    premade HTML templates, then went into working on BBCode on forumotion forms. I finally got serious
                    about coding in high school, and haven't stopped since. I'm also a community manager, moderating
                    Discord communities on the side. Behind the screen, I'm a violinist, cat nerd, fiction writer, and
                    soon-to-be wife.</p>
                <p><span class="fact">Fun Fact:</span> I had sworn since I was a little girl that I would go into
                    medicine and become a neurologist. Clearly, that plan has changed!</p>
